# Print Subscription

## Introduction

Subscribe to physical prints from Instagram feeds and/or other photosharing sites. Customers will finally be able to put up their favourite Instragram shots at home or the office, without ever having to go to a photo finisher to print them.

## Expected List of Features

* The number of prints per shipment and the frequency of shipments are both customizable so customers can enjoy flexible pricing and not be overwhelmed by prints.
* Pictures chosen for printing can be selected randomly or by total likes or by self likes so that customers don't have to worry about selecting prints themselves for each shipment.
* Subscriptions can be paused or cancelled at anytime so customers don't ever pay for more than they need.
* Subscriptions can be paid for with any major credit card.
* Pricing is all-inclusive whenever possible so customers are never suprised by additional fees.
